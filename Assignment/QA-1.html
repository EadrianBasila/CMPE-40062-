    </center>

    <p><b>Step 1:</b> You will find labels, make drawings, or take photos of the following:<br /></p>
    <p>A product containing <b> type 1 binary ionic compound</b>(one metals that forms one type of action and one
        nonmetal - <u>NO POLYATOMIC ION)</u></p>
    <p>A product <del>contain</del> containing <b> type 2 binary ionic compound</b>(one transition metals that you must
        specify the charge that forms with one nonmetal <i>NO POLYATOMIC ION)</i></p>
    <p>A product containing <b> binary molecular compound</b>(only 2 elements, both of which are nonmetals)</p>
    <p>A product containing an <b> acid</b>(this will say "acid" in the ingredients list)</p>

    <h2><mark>NOTE:</mark></h2>
    <p>Your product may use slightly <u> different </u> naming rules. If you are unsure, check with me! <br /> Make sure
        you use the standard naming system that we have learned in class when you name the compound!
